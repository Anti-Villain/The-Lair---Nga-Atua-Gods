                    In Māori mythology, Ranginui and Papatuanuku are the sky and earth gods, respectively. They are considered the parents of all other gods and mortals on earth.Rangi and Papatuanuku were originally close together, causing everything to be dark and without form. Their children, the brother gods, grew tired of living in this dark, cramped space and decided to separate their parents.The brother gods each possess unique traits and abilities. Tāne is responsible for creating the trees and planting the first seeds in the earth, while Tūmatauenga, the god of war, created the first weapons. Tūmatauenga's twin brother, Tāwhirimatea, the god of the winds and storms created the winds and rain. </p>

                    In Te Ao Māori the entire earth is known as Papatūānuku the earth Mother. All of her mokopuna that dwell upon her (including all the birds and insects of the forest who are her grandchildren) depend on her for their wellbeing. People have the option of caring for her to maintain their own health or abandoning her. Ultimately an unhealthy Papatūānuku is going to lead to unhealthy people. By always keeping in mind the needs of Papatūānuku, our people were able to appreciate what would happen to the land (and them) if it was not kept in as natural a state as was possible. They only needed to look as far as their own bodies to understand how the earth would react if either were not looked after properly. Our kaumātua tell us to take a close look at the skin on our body. We can see that it is neither smooth nor flat. Our skin is like the land, rising and falling like the peaks and valleys. This is the land, it is Papatūānuku, the land and our skin are very similar. They then say to look at the hair that covers our bodies, the covering that keeps us warm and provides protection just like the grasses and trees upon the earth. It does not take long to begin to understand what the kaumātua are impressing upon us. They remind us that Tānemahuta covered his mother in a cloak of trees and plants to keep her warm; in her cloak he placed his children to accompany her. The kaumātua say “look at the hills that have no cloak, Papatūānuku’s skin is left unprotected, it will become dry and it will fall away.” Our skin peels after too much sun, it is the same as with Papatūānuku, but we call this erosion. </p>

                <p class="pbodytextWHT">
                   Ranginui is our Skyfather, and it is from him that human life and knowledge were said to originate. In one tradition, the god Tāne climbed to the citadel Te Tihi-o-Manono, in the highest of the 12 heavens, known as Te Toi-o-ngā-rangi. There he retrieved three baskets of knowledge: te ketetuatea (basket of light), te kete-tuauri (basket of darkness) and te ketearonui (basket of pursuit). There are several interpretations of what each basket represents. The scholar Māori Marsden has suggested that the basket of light is present knowledge, the basket of darkness things unknown, and the basket of pursuit is the knowledge humans currently seek. </p>
