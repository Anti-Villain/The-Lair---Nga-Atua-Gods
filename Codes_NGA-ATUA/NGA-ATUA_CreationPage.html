                    In Māori mythology, Ranginui and Papatuanuku are the sky and earth gods, respectively. They are considered the parents of all other gods and mortals on earth.Rangi and Papatuanuku were originally close together, causing everything to be dark and without form. Their children, the brother gods, grew tired of living in this dark, cramped space and decided to separate their parents.The brother gods each possess unique traits and abilities. Tāne is responsible for creating the trees and planting the first seeds in the earth, while Tūmatauenga, the god of war, created the first weapons. Tūmatauenga's twin brother, Tāwhirimatea, the god of the winds and storms created the winds and rain. </p>
